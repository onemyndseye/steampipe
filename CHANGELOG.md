# Changelog


## [v0.0.5-dev] - 2025-04-17
### üîÑ Changed
- Major refactor of configuration handling:
  - Removed `config.py` from the codebase.
  - `--watch` flag now **requires a clips directory path**.
- `Config.APP_ID_DB` replaced with a **persistent disk-backed app ID cache** (`appid_cache.json`).
  - Prevents redundant Steam API calls and improves performance.

### ‚ú® Added
- New module: `appid_cache.py`
  - Handles transparent caching and lookups for Steam game titles by App ID.

### üßπ Clean-up & Maintenance
- All source files now pass `flake8` compliance (PEP8 styling).
- Removed unused imports and tightened long lines across codebase.
- Verified compatibility with GitHub Actions CI.

### ‚úÖ Verified Behavior
- Full pipeline verified (remux ‚Üí title resolve ‚Üí upload) up to YouTube's upload quota.
- Live test runs confirmed new structure is working and cleanly isolated.

## [0.0.4-dev] - 2025-04-17

### üîí Stability & Hardening
- Added robust `wait_for_final_chunks()` logic to avoid premature remux
- Now waits for `.m4s` fragments to fully write before processing
- Validates the **first chunk referenced in `session.mpd`** exists before remuxing

### Logic Improvements
- Improved session readiness checks using `.m4s` count and total size + idle timer
- Smart fallback if metadata or game title cannot be resolved

### Bugfixes
- Fixed silent failures from partial remuxes due to early folder access
- Corrected timing race conditions during Steam background clip saving
- Cleaned up threading behavior around `watchdog` event dispatch

## [v0.0.3-dev] - 2025-04-17

### üöÄ Added
- Full Steam clip **remuxing** support using `ffmpeg` from `.mpd` and `.m4s` fragments
- Automatic **metadata extraction** from Steam JSON (`timeline_*.json`)
- Pulls **game title** via Steam API (`GetAppList`)
- Support for **YouTube uploads** via OAuth2 + YouTube Data API v3
- `--privacy` flag to control visibility (`unlisted`, `public`, `private`)
- **Dry run mode** to simulate output and upload safely
- Support for **real-time folder watching** using Watchdog
- Queue-based clip processor with single-worker thread (handles multiple clips reliably)

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed
- Avoids premature remuxing by checking `.m4s` **chunk file stability**
- Prevents empty/0-second uploads
- Metadata properly sanitized for filesystem-safe output paths

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- Only processes the most recent chunk folder (no backfill/resume)
