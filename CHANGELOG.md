## [0.0.9-dev] - 2025-04-25

### Changed
- Moved to a cron-friendly config.   Steampipe will now interate through the given clips
  directory and act on new clips and then exit clean.  Run once from CLI or setup CRON
  job to handle scheduling.
- `--watch` renamed to `--clips`.
- Removed `--sync-delay` and `--proc-delay` options (no longer needed).
- `watch_clips()` function renamed to `find_clips()`.
- Updated README to reflect new flow and CLI usage.
- Improved Discord notification formatting with embedded thumbnails and styled messages.
- Minor internal code cleanups for path handling and mark



## [0.0.8-dev] - 2025-04-23

### Changed
- dropped ffmpeg in favor of gpac/mp4box to squash 4sec bug forever.




## [0.0.7-dev] - 2025-04-20

### Added
- `--discord <URL>` CLI argument for sending upload notifications to Discord
- Discord messages with game title and YouTube link
- YouTube link printed in CLI log after successful upload

### Changed
- `upload_video()` now returns the actual YouTube video ID
- `processor.upload()` now wraps YouTube ID as a proper short URL (`youtu.be/<id>`)



## [0.0.6-dev] - 2025-04-19

### Changed
- Replaced real-time `watchdog` logic with polling loop
- Added CLI args `--sync-delay` and `--proc-delay`
- All clips are now processed only if `.steampiped` marker file is missing
- Removed complex timing/race heuristics
- Greatly improved stability for large or delayed clips

### Added
- `.steampiped` marker written on successful upload (or simulated in dry-run)

### Removed
- No longer uses filesystem event detection (watchdog)


## [v0.0.5-dev] - 2025-4-19
-- Moved CLIPS_DIR out of config.py to required arg of --watch (steampipe --watch /path/to/clips)

### üöÄ Added
- Full Steam clip **remuxing** support using `ffmpeg` from `.mpd` and `.m4s` fragments

- Pulls **game title** via Steam API (`GetAppList`)
- Support for **YouTube uploads** via OAuth2 + YouTube Data API v3
- `--privacy` flag to control visibility (`unlisted`, `public`, `private`)
- **Dry run mode** to simulate output and upload safely
- Support for **real-time folder watching** using Watchdog
- Queue-based clip processor with single-worker thread (handles multiple clips reliably)

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed
- Avoids premature remuxing by checking `.m4s` **chunk file stability**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- Only processes the most recent chunk folder (no backfill/resume)
